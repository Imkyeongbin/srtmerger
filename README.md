subtitle merger is a tool for merging two or more subtitles for videos.
SRT Merger allows you to merge subtitle files, no matter what language are the subtitles encoded in. The result of this merge will be a new subtitle file which will display subtitles from each merged file.

### How to works?
    1. install python

    = windows =

    2-1. run `install.cmd`(install dependency)
    3-1. run `run.cmd`

    = linux =

    2-2. run `install.sh`(install dependency)
    3-2. run `run.sh`

    --

    4. enter `127.0.0.1:7860` in your browser

**Caution:**
1. Both sides should have an equal number of files for the web UI to function correctly.
2. Files are matched in alphabetical order, not by their input sequence or their order in a list.
3. Files from each side are merged one-by-one. There's no functionality to merge three or four files into one.
